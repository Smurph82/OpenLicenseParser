OpenLicenseParser
=================

OpenLicenseParser is an Android library project that allows you to easily add references of licenses from other project's to your project. This porject works by reading a simple xml file that either you or hopefully the other developer has provided.

###Xml File
The xml file can contain one to many references in one file. You could also have one xml file per license referenced. You can even mix and match meaning you have multiple xml file with multiple license in each of them. 

#####An example of a single license reference xml file.
